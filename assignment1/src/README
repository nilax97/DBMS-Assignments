The file 'jdbc.java' contains the java code to programatically insert the entries for the 'relations' table of the database using the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.

The code utilises the java.sql library to establish a connection with the database, reads a .csv file containing data and executes the statements line by line.

To run the code, first include the .jar file of the JDBC driver by running the command-
export CLASSPATH=.:/Library/Java/Extensions/postgresql-42.2.1.jar
in the terminal in the directory containing the code.

Then compile and execute the code normally.
